Project 111 (Restaurant Admin Panel) - README
How to run the first time

Clone the project. In the project directory, run:
npm i

And then run:
npm run dev

Runs the app in the development mode using vite.
Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
Notes:

    Make sure to push changes to dev branch first - main branch should be used as a latest stable release branch, which will later be used for pipelines too.
        merging dev to main should happen only in controlled manner and after rigorous testing!
